## C-001 — Nexus scope: narrow (consultant SaaS) or broad (transformation OS)?

**Asked**: 2026-06-03 by bootstrap
**Context**: Phase 3 of Night 1 writes positioning docs (0-BUSINESS, 1-PRODUCT). Two different scope framings are on the table:

**Question**: Which is canonical for Nexus v1 positioning?

**Options the agent sees**:
- **a) Narrow** (from conversation): "SaaS for consultants running AI Readiness & Transformation engagements." Consultant is the buyer + primary user; client orgs are tenants under the consultant.
- **b) Broad** (from GitHub repo description): "Multi-tenant AI-powered platform for organizations to assess AI readiness, govern transformation programs, manage strategic initiatives, capture institutional knowledge, drive accountability, and measure business outcomes." Organization is the buyer directly; no necessary consultant in the loop.
- **c) Both** (most likely intent): Consultant-led delivery is the primary GTM motion, but the platform itself can be sold direct to organizations. Positioning docs lead with consultants; capabilities docs describe both modes.

**Status**: OPEN
